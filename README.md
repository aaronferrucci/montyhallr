The Monty Hall problem:

>  Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three 
>  doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick 
>  a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, 
>  opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to

>  switch your choice?

The unspoken convention of the game is that a car is preferable to a goat.

This project simulates 10,000 runs of the game, evaluating the result
if you "stay" or "switch".
